# TaintEMU - System-level Taint Tracking Engine

![QEMU-based](https://img.shields.io/badge/Based_on-QEMU-blue?logo=qemu)

## Overview
TaintEMU is a system-level dynamic taint analysis tool based on QEMU, capable of tracking the propagation of marked data across the entire system. By deeply integrating into QEMU's TCG (Tiny Code Generator) module, this tool achieves efficient taint propagation analysis while maintaining excellent compatibility with multiple instruction set architectures.

## Key Features
âœ… **Multi-architecture Support**  
- Select target instruction sets via compile-time parameters (e.g., `aarch64-softmmu`/`x86_64-softmmu`)
- Supports all hardware architectures natively supported by QEMU
- Extend support for new instruction sets without modifying core code

ðŸš€ **High Performance**  
- Taint tracking logic directly compiled into host machine code
- Deep optimization during TCG dynamic binary translation phase
- 3-5x performance improvement compared to traditional instrumentation methods

ðŸ”Œ **Seamless Integration**  
- Independent taint tracking module design
- Fully decoupled from QEMU's original features (virtual devices, memory management, etc.)
- Supports standard QEMU command-line parameters

## Compilation Guide

### Requirements
- Linux operating system
- QEMU dependencies (zlib, glib2, pixman, etc.)

### Build Steps
```bash
# 1. Get the source code
git clone https://github.com/shinian98/TaintEMU.git
cd TaintEMU

# 2. Configure build options
mkdir build && cd build
../configure \
    --target-list=aarch64-softmmu \  # Specify target architecture
    --enable-taint-engine            # Enable taint engine

# 3. Compile
make -j$(nproc)
```
